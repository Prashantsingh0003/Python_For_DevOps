## What are Conditional Statements?

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

### Example Syntax:
```python
if condition1:
    # Code block if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code block if condition2 is True
else:
    # Code block if both conditions are False
